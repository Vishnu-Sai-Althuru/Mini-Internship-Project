Abstract:
	As the project entitles the Digitalization of question papers, this project includes the creation of a database, website(portal).
As of to start, we create a database of students of the institution using MYSQL database which includes details of the students such as Id no, name and their current year of studying and the branch details.
Then we created a portal which has mainly two users namely
i)Admin
ii)User
Where admin only has the right to delete fake and undesirable users. And he is solely responsible to upload the question papers sent to him by the students and to organize the portal. There can be more than one admin if necessary.
User has to enter their credentials in the login page. when these credentials are verified they are automatically redirected to the page where they can get access to all the question papers divided and organized according to the branches, years, sems, and subjects.
And we also use google drive for storage purposes as a backup and extension.
This project focus on the digitalization of our examination system and this project pivots on student self-realization and accountancy of their examination system.
And it strives to provide all the question papers and their solutions which aims at creating an examination networking system in the institution.

 
Conclusion:     My project can be used as a medium to store and digitalize data related to the examination system of any institution. It accounts for digital literacy. It is an easy, flexible and feasible method of digitalization of any examination system of any institution.
